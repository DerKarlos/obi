"OBI" - OSM Building Inspector (working title)

Decades ago, www.OSMgo.org was started and went from a game to a "full" 3D viewer of OSM.
As one asked vor materials support, this redooing of OSMgo in Rust was born.
But only for single buildings and building-parts for now.
And it may get editor features some day. (renamed to OBE?)
